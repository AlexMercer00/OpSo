EVNotify is a revolutionary application designed to streamline communication between powerhouses and electric vehicle (EV) charging stations. By harnessing decentralized networks, EVNotify provides users with real-time updates on charging station status, maintenance schedules, and nearby optimal charging options. Our mission is to simplify EV charging for a greener future.

### Station Updates
- Utilizes push protocol to keep users informed about closed EV stations, maintenance schedules, and updates on high-traffic charging stations.
- Employs the power of Long-Short Term Memory models (LLMs) and machine learning models to predict the load of charging stations.
